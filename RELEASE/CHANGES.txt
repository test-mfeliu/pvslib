NASA PVS Library 6.0.10 (xx/xx/xx)

6.0.10 (xx/xx/xx)
- kinematics has been renamed aviation and updated 
- TCASII, WellClear, and DAIDALUS move to github.com/nasa/WellClear/PVS
- PRECiSA moved to github.com/nasa/PRECiSA/PVS 
- reals@factorial_props moved to reals@factorial
- Added fast_approx
- Added affine arithmetic contribution (thanks to Mariano Moscato)
- Improved approximations in reals@srt_approx, lnexp_fnd@ln_approx,trig_fnd@atan_approx 
- Added best_rational to reals, which is used in interval_arith
- interval_arith: 
   . Added rational_interval
   . Improved efficiency in strategies based on interval arithmetic  
   . Parameter N has been dropped. Accuracy and precision are both governed by parameter PRECISION.
- CCG:
   . Removed typed measures in measures.pvs (it is Sign3) in theory measures.pvs
   . Renamed symbol "+" for Sign3 as "Plus3" in theory measures.pvs
   . Renamed type "measure_matrix" as "Measure_Matrix" in theory measures.pvs
   . Added criterion for positivity based on size of circuits in theory matrix_wdg.pvs 

6.0.9 (November 10 2014)
- General library updates
- Added PVSioChecker
- Added Stum and Tarski's development
- Added Bernstein (unfortunately, strategy is not working yet due to some changes in PVS 6.0)

6.0.8 (March 14 2014)
- Updated digraph (thanks to Andreia Avelar Borges)
- Updated ACCoRD, lnexp_fnd, analysis, lebesgue, trig_fnd, and complex_integration

6.0.7 (February 28 2014)
- Corrected misspelling of "schwarz" in vectors, vect_analysis, and ACCoRD
- vectors: 
   Added vectors_4D.
   Renamed "sq" in vectors as "sos" (sum of squares). This change avoids a name clash with reals@sq
   The following lemmas changed names: sqv_sq -> sqv_sos, norms_eq_sq -> norms_eq_sos.
- interval_arith:
   Removed options const and rats from numerical and interval. These options are not needed anymore.
- Moved Stosic's contributions choice_facts and refaniment_relations to set_aux
- Moved Stosic's contribution allen to interval_arith
- Added analysis_ax, an axiomatic version of analysis
- Added development Sturm, which includes the decision procedure sturm for univariate polynomials
- pvsio and proveit: 
   Added options -disable-oracles, -disable <oracle>, -enable <oracle>, to disable all oracles, disable 
   <oracle>, or reenable <oracle>, respectively. Currently, the only
   oracle that is supported is MetiTarski.
   Fixed options -tex and -txt in script proveit. These options generate latex and text proofs from PVS proof scripts.

6.0.6 (September 4 2013)
- Added PVS 6.0 patches (thanks to Sam Owre)
- Fixed small bugs in metit and added support for some symbols, e.g., =>, &, <=> (thanks to 
  Viorel Preoteasaa)

6.0.5 (June 13 2013)
- Fixed the broken proof in 6.0.4b
- Improved interval_arith to include support for safe and proper arithmetic 
  operations.

- Fixed old bugs in PVSio, e.g., added support for constant semantic attachments
- Integrated MetiTarski 2.2/Z3 4.3.1 to PVS through the proof rule metit (William 
  Denman's contribution). The proof rule metit solves universally quantified first-order 
  formulas over real-valued expressions involving trignometric functions, ln, exp, and sqrt. 

6.0.4b (May 13 2013)
- Special distribution for VSTTE Summer School 2013 (1 proof is broken).

- Removed orphan and outdated theories
- Added PVS patches

6.0.3 (Feb 23 2013)
- Added Allen interval temporal logic (Dragan Stoic's contribution)

6.0.2 (February 13 2013)
- Added satisfiability and validity checker for simplify quantified formulas and 
  Boolean expressions via interval arithmetic (see strategy interval in interval-arith)
- Added sets as list to structures

6.0.1 (February 3 2013)
- Added exponential to interval_arith

6.0 (January 26 2013)
- Updated to PVS 6.0. This version of the library includes several upgrades, e.g.,
  structures: 
  - Added for-loops and iterations (for_iterate, for_examples).
  - Added Maybe and Unit types (Maybe, Unit).
  - Added a preliminary array theory tailored towards ground evaluation (arrays).
  - Added a generic branch and bound algorithm (branch_and_bound).
  - Added a type of lists of n elements (listn).
  - Added array to list functions (array2list).
  interval_arith:
  - Added a formal proofs of Inclusion and Fundamental theorems of interval arithmetic.
  - Completely redefined strategies: numerical and interval.These strategies
    are now based on computational reflection and are much more efficient than
    the previous strategies numerical and instint.
  - For a complete list of strategies available in interval_arith, use
    the proof command interval-about.

  digraphs:
  - Revisited several definitions and lemmas.

- The packages Extrategies and Field, which are now part of PVS, have been 
  completely revisited. The strategies in these packages handle TCCs in a 
  much better way. Unfortunately, this may cause some strategies to behave in a
  slightly way and to break some old proofs. In particular, SKOLETIN
  may generate proofs in a different order. In most cases, the old 
  behavior of SKOLETIN can be simulated by setting the option :old? to t.
  
  Extrategies provides new strategy combinators for building strategies. 
  In particular, it includes the proof command deftactic for defining local 
  strategies (called tactics), whose scope is the branch of the proof where the
  tactic is declared.  For a complete list of strategies available in
  Extrategies and Field, use the proof command extrategies-about and
  field-about.

- The Bernstein development is still missing in this version of the library. 
  It will be released soon.

5.2 Changes (Feb 29, 2008)
--------------------------
   -- Add library "fs" which is just a holding place for theories that
      should be in finite_sets.  These will hopefully be moved there
      in the next release of PVS.

   -- moved abs_props and real_facts into reals library. NOTE
      (stop-rewrite "abs_0")  (stop-rewrite "abs_nat") may 
      be helpful in repairing broken proofs that use analysis library
      or reals@abs_lems.  Can also use AUTO_REWRITE- in theory.
